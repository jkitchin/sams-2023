# Welcome to the Jupyter Lab Workshop for SAMS 2023

## Aim for today

Climate change is happening all over the world. It manifests itself in changing weather patterns over time including different patterns in precipitation and temperature. Our aim today is to do some data analysis on the average temperatures in the United States using data provided by https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/.

We have three goals:
1. Introduce the Jupyter Lab computational environment
2. Learn about some data science with an application in climate change
3. an Open ended project for you to practice these skills

## About Jupyter lab

Jupyter Lab is a computational environment that runs in your browser where you can write and run code to solve problems, perform analyses, and make graphical representations of data. 

There are many ways to run Jupyter, including Google Colab, installing it locally on your own computer, or using it in the Cloud.

This workshop will introduce Jupyter Lab through https://www.amdatascience.com/, which is an online cloud platform developed by a CMU alum, Andrew Chang. His company is providing you with a Pro subscription for 1-month to this service.

To get started, open this link [introduction.ipynb](introduction.ipynb). Look for a rocket icon at the top, hover your mouse on it and select the JupyterHUB icon:

If you need to log in, select "Continue with Google", and log in with your Andrew id. Then select the "Professor Kitchin Workshop S2023", scroll to the bottom and click start. This should open the file in your Jupyter lab after it starts up.

## If you have trouble, find bugs or typos

You can file an issue by looking for the octocat icon at the top, and selecting "Open issue" on any page.
