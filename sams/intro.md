# Welcome to the Jupyter Lab Workshop for SAMS 2023

Jupyter Lab is a computational environment that runs in your browser where you can write and run code to solve problems, perform analyses, and make graphical representations of data.

This workshop will introduce Jupyter Lab through https://www.amdatascience.com/, which is an online platform developed by a CMU alum.

To get started, open this link [introduction.ipynb](introduction.ipynb). Look for a rocket icon at the top, hover your mouse on it and select the JupyterHUB icon:

If you need to log in, select "Continue with Google", and log in with your Andrew id. Then select the "Professor Kitchin Workshop S2023", scroll to the bottom and click start. This should open the file in your Jupyter lab after it starts up.
