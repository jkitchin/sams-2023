# Welcome to the Jupyter Lab Workshop for SAMS 2023

Jupyter Lab is a computational environment that runs in your browser where you can write and run code to solve problems, perform analyses, and make graphical representations of data.

This workshop will introduce Jupyter Lab through https://www.amdatascience.com/, which is an online platform developed by a CMU alum.
